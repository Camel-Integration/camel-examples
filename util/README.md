# Utility Components
This directory contains utility components that can be used in other examples.<br>
I though would be good to create some services that you can spin up locally and pretty much be able to execute examples
without having to worry about external dependencies.<br>
The public **NumberToWord SOAP Web Service** is used in multiple example, and in case that service is no longer available, you can use the
number-converter-service to spin up a local instance of the service.

- [number-converter-service](number-converter-service/README.md) (convert number to word both SOAP and REST)
